# Audit Report of Proxy Contract:
The Proxy contract is a generic contract that allows executing all transactions by applying the code of a master contract. The master contract is set in the constructor, and all transactions are forwarded to the master contract using delegatecall().

The contract code is relatively simple, with a constructor that sets the masterCopy address and a fallback function that forwards all transactions using delegatecall(). The code is well-commented and follows best practices.

We did not find any critical vulnerabilities in the contract code, and the code is secure as long as the master contract is secure. However, the following issues were identified that could affect the functionality of the contract:

1. The constructor function should use the "view" keyword when reading data from the state variable to improve efficiency.

2. The contract does not implement any access control, which means anyone can execute any function on the master contract. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the master contract data.

3. The contract does not implement a withdrawal pattern to protect against reentrancy attacks. If the master contract includes any functions that transfer ether, this can lead to reentrancy attacks.

4. The fallback function uses inline assembly, which can be difficult to read and understand. A better approach would be to use a library or a separate function.

5. The contract does not include any events, which can make it difficult to track and audit transactions.

## Vulnerabilities, Impact, POC

Vulnerability: Lack of withdrawal pattern
Impact: High
Proof of Concept (POC): An attacker can call a function on the master contract that transfers ether, and then reenter the fallback function and execute additional functions on the master contract.
Importance to Treat: Critical

The contract does not implement a withdrawal pattern to protect against reentrancy attacks. If the master contract includes any functions that transfer ether, this can lead to reentrancy attacks. The master contract should implement a withdrawal pattern to protect against this type of attack.
